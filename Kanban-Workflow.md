# Kanban Workflow

## 🔍 Research & Learn

### How does a Kanban board work?
A Kanban board is a visual tool that shows tasks as cards moving through stages of work. It helps teams manage workflow by making progress and bottlenecks visible.

### What do the columns represent?
- **Backlog**: Tasks not yet started
- **To Do**: Tasks ready to begin
- **In Progress**: Tasks currently being worked on
- **Blocked**: Tasks that are stuck and need help
- **Done**: Completed tasks

### How do tasks move and who updates them?
Tasks move from left to right through the board. Team members are responsible for updating their own tasks as they start or finish them.

### What are the benefits of limiting WIP (Work In Progress)?
- Reduces task switching
- Speeds up delivery
- Prevents overload
- Keeps focus on completing work before starting new items

## 📝 Reflection

### How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?
Kanban helps by making work visible, so you can see what’s already being done and avoid taking on too much. WIP limits keep the team focused and balanced.

### How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?
I can improve by regularly updating the board, limiting how many tasks I work on at the same time, and checking the board each day to stay organized.

## 🛠️ Task 

### Kanban Board Observation
I looked at Focus Bear’s GitHub Project board. Tasks were well-structured, and each one had labels and clear status columns like Super/Very Low Priority, In Progress, and QA Passed/Done.

### Task Moved
I moved a task from “In Progress” → “Done” after completing it.

### One Improvement Idea
I can improve task tracking by writing more detailed task descriptions, so the team better understands each task’s purpose and progress.
