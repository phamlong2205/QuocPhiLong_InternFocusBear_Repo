# Agile Team Roles & Collaboration

## üîç Research Summary

### Key Roles in an Agile Team

- **Developer**: Builds and maintains the product by writing code and implementing features.
- **Quality Assurance (QA)**: Tests the software to ensure it works correctly and reports bugs.
- **Product Manager (PM)**: Prioritizes work, defines features, and ensures the team builds the right product.
- **Agile Project Manager (Agile PM)**: Supports the team in following Agile principles, removing blockers, and tracking progress.
- **Stakeholders**: Clients, business owners, or users who have an interest in the final product.
- **UX Designer**: Designs user-friendly interfaces and ensures a good experience.
- **Customer Support**: Communicates with users and passes feedback or issues to the team.

### Collaboration in Scrum vs. Kanban

- **Scrum**:
  - Work is organized in sprints.
  - Roles are clearly defined (Scrum Master, Product Owner, etc.).
  - More structured ceremonies (Planning, Stand-up, Review, Retrospective).
  - QA and Devs work closely during the sprint to finish tasks.

- **Kanban**:
  - Work is done continuously (no sprints).
  - Roles are more flexible.
  - Focus is on limiting WIP and improving flow.
  - Everyone collaborates to keep tasks moving across the board.

## üìù Reflection

### My Role and Contribution to Agile

I am a **Mobile App Developer**.

In the Agile process, I contribute by:
- Developing mobile features based on product requirements.
- Collaborating with QA to ensure smooth functionality.
- Updating the status of tasks on the Kanban board as I work on them.
- Participating in stand-ups to communicate progress and blockers.

### How My Role Interacts with Others

I frequently work with the **UX Designer** to make sure the app looks and feels right on mobile devices. We collaborate on layout decisions, animations, and design adjustments.

I also work with the **Product Manager**, who helps prioritize which features are most important.

## üõ†Ô∏è Task Output

### My Role in the Agile Team

As a **Mobile App Developer**, I turn design ideas and user stories into real, working mobile features. I build and test these features, make sure they match designs and user expectations, and fix bugs based on QA or user feedback. I keep tasks updated on the Kanban board so the team knows what's in progress or done.

### One Role I Frequently Collaborate With

I often collaborate with the **QA team**.

To improve teamwork with QA, I can:
- Share test builds earlier so they have more time to test.
- Write clear notes on how features work or what to expect.
- Review QA feedback quickly and ask questions when issues are unclear.
