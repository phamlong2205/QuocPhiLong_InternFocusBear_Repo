# Set Up AI Tools for Development   

## Which AI tools did you try?
- GitHub Copilot, for coding
- ChatGPT, for writing reports and normal questions 
- Claude, mainly for coding
- Perplexity, for writing essays

## What worked well
- **GitHub Copilot:** Great for quick code generation, autocomplete suggestions and explaination while typing in VS Code.
- **Claude:** Very good in creating the code, I just need to prompt carefully including everything I want and it comes up with an actual useful code.
- **ChatGPT:** Very helpful in answering general questions and explaining concepts in simple terms.
- **Perplexity:** Famous for its "Research" mode and it is actually good with professional style of writing and citations of the sources.

## What did not work well
- All the AIs sometimes make things up when trying to give the answer, I need to prompt carefully to avoid that.
- Copilot sometimes suggested code that didn’t match my exact needs — needed manual adjustments.
- ChatGPT occasionally gave outdated or incorrect syntax, so I had to verify results.

## When AI is most useful for coding
- Creating the plan the code structure with detailed prompt.
- Getting unstuck when debugging errors, the idea of debug is from myself, and with that information, I can prompt the AI to fix the code properly and reduce the time.
- Learning new programming concepts with examples.
- Refactoring code for better readability.
