# Learning Goals

## What do you hope to learn from this internship?
I hope to gain more hands-on experience in real-world software development, especially in building and improving applications used by real users. I also want to understand Agile workflows in practice and learn how to work effectively within a professional development team.

## What skills are you most excited to develop?
I’m most excited to develop my skills in front-end and mobile app development, improve my UI/UX understanding, and work with tools like React and Figma. I also want to strengthen my problem-solving skills in a collaborative environment.

## What do you think you can contribute to the team?
I can contribute strong programming skills in Python and C#, experience in building structured projects, and a good understanding of algorithms and cloud technologies. I’m also reliable in teamwork, communication, and delivering tasks on time.

## What is one area you feel less confident in that you’d like to improve?
I feel less confident in designing user-friendly interfaces and optimising user experience. I’d like to improve my design sense and learn how to make apps both functional and enjoyable to use.

## What does success in this internship look like for you?
Success for me means learning new skills, applying what I’ve learned to make a real impact on the product, improving my weaker areas, and becoming a more well-rounded developer who can work confidently in a team.
