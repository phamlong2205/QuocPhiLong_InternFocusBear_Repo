# 🤖 AI Usage Guidelines – Focus Bear

## 🔍 What I’ve Learned

### What AI Tools Are Useful for My Role?

As a Mobile App Developer, I find tools like:
- **GitHub Copilot** useful for quick code suggestions and reducing typing.
- **ChatGPT/Perplexity/Claude** helps explain unfamiliar concepts, generate starter templates, and refactor code.
- AI tools can also help with documentation or writing internal notes.

### Benefits and Risks of AI at Work

**Benefits:**
- Faster task completion
- Generates ideas when I’m stuck
- Helps understand tricky or new code

**Risks:**
- Inaccurate or outdated suggestions
- Possible data leaks if sensitive info is entered
- Can weaken understanding if overused

### What info should never be entered into AI tools?
- Passwords or login details
- Personal info (name, address, ID...)
- Bank or credit card info
- Company secrets (internal docs, code, user data)

### How to fact-check AI-generated content?
- Google it or check trusted websites
- Use official sources (docs, news, gov sites)
- Ask a team member or expert if unsure

## 📝 Reflection

### When to Use AI vs. My Own Skills

- I use AI for **ideas, templates, or initial drafts** — but always review before using.
- I rely on **my own debugging, and logic skills** for actual implementation or decision-making.

### Avoiding Over-Reliance

- I treat AI like a “coding assistant,” not a replacement for thinking.
- I make time to learn and understand the problem before asking AI.
- I review all AI code output line-by-line before using it in production.

### Ensuring Data Privacy

- I never paste **company codebase, client data, or sensitive info** into public AI tools.
- I use environment variables for secrets instead of sharing them in prompts.
- I check if an AI tool is **approved** for use at Focus Bear before trying it.

## 🛠️ Task Summary

### One Task I Improved with AI

I used Claude to help generate a draft version of a **unit test** for my team's project last semester. It gave a solid structure, but I had to adjust it to match team’s codebase and testing style.

### Was Fact-Checking Needed?

Yes, I double-checked the method names and library imports.  
Some changes were needed to fit the version of the framework we use.

### One Best Practice I’ll Follow

I will **always sanitize input and avoid pasting sensitive data into AI tools**, and I’ll review all AI output critically before using it in Focus Bear projects.
