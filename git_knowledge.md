# Git Knowledge

## Have you used Git before? If so, in what context?
Yes, I have used Git before, but only for basic tasks like cloning repositories, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub. Most of my previous experience was in group projects for university assignments where we needed to track changes via GitHub. However, I haven’t worked much with Git in a professional team environment before, so I’m looking forward to learning more about branches, pull requests, and proper workflows.

## Which Git client (if any) did you choose? Why?
I chose **GitHub Desktop** as my Git client.  
The reasons are:
- It has a simple and beginner-friendly interface.
- It integrates directly with GitHub, making it easy to visualize commits and branches.
- I can still use Git commands in the terminal when needed, but GitHub Desktop helps me clearly see what changes I’m making.
- It also makes it easier to stage specific files, write commit messages, and push without memorizing all the commands.

## What was the most interesting thing you learned about Git today?
Today, I learned more about the **Git commit history** and how to view it in both GitHub Desktop and the command line using:
```bash
git log --oneline
