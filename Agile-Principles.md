# Agile Principles & Frameworks

## üîç Research Summary

### What is Agile?

Agile is a flexible approach to project management that focuses on short development cycles, frequent feedback, and adapting to change. Unlike traditional waterfall methods, Agile does not try to plan everything upfront ‚Äî it encourages continuous improvement and collaboration.

### Agile Core Values (from the Agile Manifesto)

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools  
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation  
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation  
4. Responding to change over following a plan

### Scrum vs. Kanban

| Feature             | Scrum                              | Kanban                              |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Structure           | Sprint-based (e.g., 2-week sprints) | Continuous, no timeboxes             |
| Roles               | Scrum Master, Product Owner         | Flexible roles                       |
| Meetings            | Daily Stand-ups, Retrospectives     | Fewer required meetings              |
| Work Planning       | Planned before the sprint           | Pulled as capacity allows            |
| Use Case            | Best for structured, goal-based work | Best for continuous delivery         |

### Why Focus Bear Uses Kanban

## üõ†Ô∏è Task Output

### Scrum vs. Kanban Summary (In My Own Words)

Scrum works in fixed sprints with planning and meetings, while Kanban is more flexible, letting you pull tasks continuously as you have time. Scrum is best when you have clear sprint goals, while Kanban is great for continuous updates and quick changes ‚Äî which fits mobile app development well.

### One Agile Principle That‚Äôs Most Useful

**‚ÄúDeliver working software frequently.‚Äù**  
This principle helps me focus on building small, working pieces of an app and releasing them often. It allows the team to get feedback early and make improvements faster.
