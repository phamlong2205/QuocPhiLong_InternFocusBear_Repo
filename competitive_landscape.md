# Competitive Landscape – Focus Bear vs. Other Productivity Apps

From my research on Focus Bear and other productivity apps listed, these are my reflections about Focus Bear compared to other apps:

## 1. What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?

- Blocks distractions across all devices with **Gentle Mode** prompting access and a harsher **Grizzly Bear** mode for strict blocking.
- **Use visual cues** to increase focus, small details of visualization in the screen can play an important role in enhancing concentration, especially to people who have ADHD.
- **Pep talk** in different styles, which is a really great idea to keep users motivated during work, as they might feel their efforts are recognised.

## 2. If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?

As a user, I’d choose Focus Bear for its **Cuddly** and **Grizzly Bear** modes, which provide flexibility depending on my mood or need:
- **Cuddly Bear Mode** gives gentle reminders without being overly strict.
- **Grizzly Bear Mode** completely blocks distractions for deep focus.
- This combination allows me to switch between soft guidance and hardcore focus, unlike most blockers that are either too soft or too strict.

## 3. What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?
- **Freedom** has a feature called **Ambient noise for focus**, allows users to be transported to a café, library, office or nature, creates a better environment for work. Ambient sounds help users focus and feel ensconced in their work.

## 4. Based on your research, what’s one improvement Focus Bear could make?

- **Browser Extensions**: Freedom has this feature, so it is easier for users to make adjustment or view the logs without changing tabs. From a user's point of view, I find it more convenient and I am more likely to use the app when it is embedded in my browser.
- **Visual Design/UI** : Competitors like Tiimo and Routinery have cleaner, more engaging visuals with better iconography, color palettes, fonts and layouts. A more modern and visually appealing interface could help retain users who value aesthetics and ease of use.
