## 📝 Reflection

**Which shortcuts will be most useful in daily work?**  
The **multiple cursor shortcuts** (`Alt + Click` and `Ctrl + D`) will be the most useful because I often need to edit repeated patterns or make bulk changes in code. Also, `Ctrl + P` for quick file search will save me a lot of time.

**How can keyboard shortcuts improve productivity?**  
Shortcuts help me avoid constantly moving my hand to the mouse, which speeds up editing and navigation. They also help me stay in a “flow state” because I can quickly switch files, make edits, and debug without breaking focus.

**Push the file to your public GitHub repo and submit a PR.**  
I already pushed my markdown files so far to my public GitHub repo and submitted a pull request
