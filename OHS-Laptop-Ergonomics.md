# OHS – Laptop Ergonomics Reflection

## 🔍 Research Summary

### Risks of Using a Laptop Without Accessories
Using a laptop alone for long periods can cause:
- Neck and back strain from looking down
- Wrist pain from awkward typing angles
- Eye strain due to improper screen height and lighting
- Poor posture from hunching or slouching

### Ergonomic Equipment That Can Help
- **Laptop Stand**: Raises the screen to eye level
- **External Keyboard and Mouse**: Allows for better wrist posture
- **Ergonomic Chair**: Supports the back and encourages upright sitting
- **Monitor (optional)**: Larger screen placed at a comfortable height
- **Footrest**: Keeps feet flat if the chair is too high

### Ideal Workspace Adjustments
- **Monitor**: Top of screen at or just below eye level
- **Chair**: Back straight, hips at 90°, feet flat on the floor
- **Keyboard and Mouse**: At elbow height, wrists straight
- **Lighting**: Reduce screen glare to protect eyes

### Healthy Daily Habits
- Follow the **20-20-20 rule** to avoid eye strain
- Take movement breaks every 30–60 minutes
- Perform posture checks regularly
- Use tools like **Focus Bear** for break reminders and stretching routines
