# Company Reflection

## Why do you think Focus Bear was created?
I think Focus Bear was created because Jeremy Nagel, the CEO, personally understands the struggles of living with ADHD. From what I remembered, he had a tendency to do many things at the same time if he could not manage well and then nothing end up progressing properly. Focus Bear was created to help people with the same struggle to be more productive in not just learning and working, but also in daily routine.

## What problem is Focus Bear solving?
Focus Bear is helping people with ADHD, autism, and even those without a diagnosis who still struggle with distractions, productivity, and finishing tasks. It’s trying to solve the problem of losing focus too easily, especially in school or work, by blocking distractions and giving structured reminders for healthy habits.

## Why do you think this mission is important?
This mission is important because losing focus or struggling with time management can have a huge impact on someone’s life, like not finishing uni or having trouble keeping a job. I also think it’s important because mental health is related to productivity, and helping people be more in control can improve their confidence and quality of life. 

## How does Focus Bear’s work align with your personal values or interests?
I value tools that actually help people in practical ways. As someone who’s into tech, I like that Focus Bear combines software development with making a positive impact. I also care about mental health awareness, so working on something that supports people with ADHD or autism feels meaningful. 

## Do you personally relate to any of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve?
Although not having ADHD or autism (I am not so sure about this) but I still have problem with my concentration, so I find working in a project like Focus Bear can give me not just experience as an intern, but also some useful tips as a guy who used to cannot focus for more than 10 minutes.

## Do you know someone with ADHD or autism or even someone without a diagnosis who has struggled socially or to perform well at uni? How might Focus Bear help them?
Yes, I’ve seen people around me struggle with focus like me. My best friend in high school doesn’t have an official ADHD diagnosis but still struggles with focus and keeping up with deadlines. He often leaves assignments until the last minute and gets overwhelmed because there are so many tasks (I also have these problems). In my country, there’s even a famous rapper who has ADHD, and he’s talked about how it affected his daily life in the past. I think Focus Bear could help people like them by blocking distractions during study or working time so they can actually focus on their tasks. The habit reminders could also help them build a consistent routine and take breaks without losing track of time.
