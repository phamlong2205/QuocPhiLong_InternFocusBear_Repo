- Share documents only with **authorized team members** through secure channels.
- Log out of shared systems when not in use.

### How to Respond to a Data Breach

## üìù Reflection

### Steps I Will Take to Handle Data Securely

As a **Mobile App Developer**, I will:
- Double-check that no API keys or credentials are committed to GitHub.
- Use `.env` files to store environment variables locally.
- Use strong, unique passwords with 2FA enabled on all accounts.
- Keep devices locked and encrypted when not in use.

### How I‚Äôll Store, Share, and Dispose of Data

- **Store**: Use secure cloud services or encrypted folders.
- **Share**: Use Slack or other company-approved tools only with authorized people.
- **Dispose**: Regularly clean up old data/files and empty trash securely.

### Common Mistake to Avoid

A common mistake is **pushing secrets to public repos**. I will:
- Use `.gitignore` to prevent committing `.env` files
- Regularly audit my repos to check for exposed sensitive info

## üõ†Ô∏è Task Summary

### One Practice I Will Adopt

I will start using **Focus Bear reminders** to perform a weekly check of my local and GitHub repos to ensure no sensitive data is accidentally exposed.

### One Key Learning

**Never commit secrets into version control.**  
Even a temporary leak can be captured and misused. Instead, always use `.env` files and secret managers.
