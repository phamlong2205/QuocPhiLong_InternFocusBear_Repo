# Set Up Dev Productivity Chrome Extensions

## Extensions Installed
- I have installed the required tools in my Chrome:
1. **React Developer Tools**: Inspect React components
2. **Redux DevTools**: Debug Redux state 
3. **JSON Viewer**: Pretty-print API responses
4. **Lighthouse**: Audit site performance

## Why I Installed Them
- These tools help with front-end development, debugging, and performance optimization.
- They make it easier to inspect app structure, data flow, and user experience quality.

## Most Useful Thing I Learned
- I discovered how **Redux DevTools** can "time travel" through state changes, making it easier to debug complex bugs.
