# Agile Ceremonies & Team Collaboration

## üîç Research & Learn

### Daily Stand-ups
Short daily meetings (usually 15 minutes) where team members share:
- What they have done and what they are planning to do next
- Any issues they are facing
The purpose is to keep everyone aligned and helps identify issues early.

### Sprint Planning (Scrum)
A meeting at the beginning of each sprint to plan and agree on the work to be done. The team selects items from the product backlog to work on.

### Continuous Prioritization (Kanban)
In Kanban, there are no fixed sprints. Work items are continuously prioritized and pulled by the team as they become available.

### Retrospectives
Meetings held at the end of each sprint to reflect on:
- What went well and what did not
- What can be improved next time

### Backlog Refinement
Regular sessions to:
- Review upcoming tasks
- Break large items into smaller tasks
- Clarify requirements
- Re-prioritize based on feedback or changes

## üåç Asynchronous Collaboration Across Time Zones

Agile teams often work across different time zones. They collaborate using tools like:
- **Slack / Microsoft Teams**: Chat, updates, async discussions
- **Jira / Trello / Asana**: Task tracking and progress visibility
- **Notion / Confluence**: Documentation and shared knowledge
- **Loom / Zoom recordings**: Video updates or recorded meetings

These tools help teams stay aligned even when not online at the same time.

## üìù Reflection

### How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?
Agile ceremonies ensure regular check-ins, structured planning, and shared reflection. They reduce misunderstandings, keep the team focused, and build a habit of continuous improvement.

### Most Important Ceremony for My Role
I think **Daily Stand-up** is the most important for my role because it keeps me in sync with the rest of the team. I can share updates, get help with blockers, and understand what others are working on in real time.
