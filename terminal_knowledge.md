# Set Up a Terminal Client & Get Comfortable with the Command Line

## Terminal Client Chosen
**Windows Terminal + PowerShell**  
I chose this because it’s modern, customizable, and supports multiple shells in one place.

## Customizations Made
- Theme: One Half Dark for better contrast.
- Font: Cascadia Code for readability.
- Aliases for common git commands like `gs` (git status) and `gl` (git log).

## Most Useful Command Learned
`ls` – Lists all files and folders in the current directory.  
It’s simple but I use it all the time to quickly see where I am and what files I have.
